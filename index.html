            <h1>What is the Internet?</h1>
            <p>The Internet is a large network of computers worldwide, which can exchange information between them.
                They can communicate because they are linked through telephone connections, cable, waves or another type
                of technology and thanks to the fact that they use a common language or protocol, TCP / IP, which are
                rules that tell us how data has to travel through the net.<br>
                How does the Internet work?
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="container-content">

            <h1>Internet architecture</h1>
            <p>
                Possibly the Internet can be considered the largest communications network on the planet, often referred
                to as "the network of networks" and formed by the interconnection of thousands (or even millions) of
                networks around the world.<br><br>

                We tend to think of the Internet as something abstract, often represented as a cloud that provides us
                with access to a large number of services..<br><br>

                The current structure of the Internet is based on the interconnection of networks in a more or less
                hierarchical way with several levels, known as tiers. In general, there are three levels known as Tier
                1, Tier 2 and Tier 3.<br><br>

                Types of connections between operators: The connection between the networks of different operators can
                be done in two ways:<br><br>

                Transit connections. Connection between operators of different hierarchy. The higher-ranking operator
                (provider) sells a transit connection to the lower-ranking operator (customer). The provider gives the
                customer access to all its routes, that is, the customer will receive both the routes from the
                provider's network and routes to other networks. The client publishes to the supplier only his routes
                and not others that he may have with other suppliers.<br><br>

                By definition, Tier 1 networks are the only ones that do not use transit connections.<br><br>
                Peering connection. Connection used for the exchange of traffic without cost between two operators. Each
                operator publishes only its routes and not other routes that it has with other providers or other
                peering routes, that is, the peering is used to access from an operator to the range of IP addresses of
                the other operator, but it does not serve to reach other ranges of addresses.<br><br>
            </P>

            <H2>HTTP vs HTTPS</H2>
            <p>
                In order to understand the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, it is essential to know how the
                transmission of information works on the network. In other words, it is important that you know what
                HTTP is, how it evolved over the years and how HTTPS was born, a more secure information protocol that
                is becoming a standard when it comes to surfing the Internet.<br><br>

                What is HTTP?
                Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (or Hypertext Transfer Protocol in Spanish) is an application layer
                protocol for the transmission of hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication
                between web browsers and servers, although it can be used for other purposes as well. It follows the
                classic client-server model, in which a client establishes a connection, making a request to a server
                and waiting for a response from it. It is a stateless protocol, which means that the server does not
                save any data (state) between two requests. Although in most cases it is based on a connection of the
                TCP / IP type, it can be used on any secure or trusted transport layer, that is, on any protocol that
                does not lose messages silently, such as UDP.<br><br>

                The need arose then to protect the information that is transferred between the user's browser and the
                web servers, that is, a more secure protocol was necessary to encrypt the connections so that no
                malicious user could intercept or steal it. Thus HTTPS arose.<br>

                The main difference between HTTP and HTTPS is security. The HTTPS protocol prevents other users from
                intercepting the information that is transferred between the client and the web server.<br><br>

            <h2>DNS</h2>
            <p>
                DNS is the acronym that forms the denomination Domain Name System or Domain Name System and in addition
                to pointing the domains to the corresponding server, it will help us to translate the real address,
                which is a numerical relationship called IP, in the domain name.<br><br>

                What are DNS for?<br>
                Well, DNS is used to tell the user who types a domain to which server he should go to pick up the web
                page he wants to consult.<br><br>

                Indeed the web pages are actually hosted under an IP address, for example our website www.digival.es
                really responds to the IP 85.112.29.231 but this system is capable of converting these numbers into the
                domain name www.digival.es. Remembering the IPs of each web page would be too hard work, that's why the
                domain name system was created, to allow creating terms and names that are easier to remember.<br><br>

                How DNS works<br>
                What better way to explain it with a practical example, and with actions that we carry out every day.
                Continuing with the example of our website or any other that has been contracted with our web hosting
                plans, suppose that a user wishes to access it, for which, he types our domain www.digival.es in his
                browser. When pressing the enter key, the browser will consult with the DNS server what is the IP
                address of our domain, and in turn it will match the information between the IP and the domain name,
                finally it will deliver to the browser the IP 85.112.29.231 that it can return our website to our
                user.<br><br>

                How to change DNS<br>
                As a domain registrar that we are, we provide a control panel that allows you to make these changes
                online. In our case, it is important to be clear that to change the DNS of an individual domain, it is
                necessary to go to the "Domains" section and configure the DNS of the domain individually, either by
                writing the new ones that we want to assign or by choosing among the ones we have. recorded in our
                Customer Area.<br>

                We must be careful with DNS management, because as we have already explained, it depends on them that
                our domain works, or what is the same, our website, our mail or our applications and databases.<br><br>

            <h1>Web Servers</h1>
            <p>
                By "Web server" we can mean hardware or software, or both working together.<br><br>

                In terms of hardware, a web server is a computer that stores the files that make up a website (eg HTML
                documents, images, CSS style sheets, and JavaScript files) and delivers them to the end-user device. It
                is connected to the internet and is accessible through a domain name like mozilla.org.<br>

                In terms of software, a web server has many parties in charge of control over how users access files, at
                least one HTTP server. An HTTP server is a piece of software that comprises URLs (web addresses) and
                HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view web pages).<br>

                At the most basic level, whenever a browser needs a file stored on a web server, the browser will make a
                request to the server via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct web server (hardware), the HTTP
                server (software) sends the previously requested file, also through HTTP. <br>
                By "Web server" we can mean hardware or software, or both working together.<br><br>

            <h1>Traditional Web Hosting vs. Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>
                Traditional Hosting vs. Cloud Hosting: Benefits and Drawbacks of Each
                ‘Cloud hosting vs traditional hosting’ is a complicated question that depends on a variety of factors
                unique to each client. Thus, deciding whether to choose cloud hosting or traditional hosting is a
                case-by-case basis.<br><br>

                Although cloud hosting is a growing force in Internet storage and website creation, traditional hosting
                users should not be worried. Traditional hosting still provides a wide array of benefits that will make
                it relevant for many years to come.<br><br>

                1. Traditional Hosting: Traditional hosting uses hosted servers to provide storage services to the
                client. Storage servers are installed at various locations, and through the use of the Internet,
                services are then made available to clients. There are three subcategories of traditional web hosting,
                each with its own benefits and drawbacks:<br><br>

                Shared Hosting: Shared hosting is the most common among small businesses and is sharing the storage
                server with multiple other websites. This kind of hosting is cheaper than other types of hosting, as the
                entire cost of a single server is divided among many clients. However, if your business is expanding,
                then you should think twice before choosing this seemingly inexpensive option because what’s saved in
                price will be lost in slower loading times and high web traffic, as there is a large number of users
                using the same resources.<br><br>

                Dedicated Servers: This category of web hosting is best for websites that receive 100K visitors on a
                daily or monthly basis. With this huge amount of traffic, these websites need higher load times to
                prevent a crash. Dedicated servers are also great for customization; you can choose every basic and
                professional area of your server, from the amount of space to the operating system, and also the
                hardware elements. Opting for dedicated servers allows you the desired flexibility that you need.
                Virtual private servers (VPS): Virtual private servers or VPS can be the most balanced web hosting
                service to upgrade to. One cool feature of VPS is that it maintains equality amongst all users unlike
                shared hosting. In other words, the VPS server will divide the resources available equally among all the
                participants. If the RAM is 20GB and storage space is 200GB, assuming that it’s limited to 10 users, the
                division will provide 2GB RAM and 20GB storage for each user.<br><br>

                2. Cloud Hosting: Cloud computing is an entirely different ballgame than traditional hosting, but it
                does share some characteristics with VPS Hosting. In cloud hosting, you’re allowed to use the computer
                resources rather than owning a personal server.<br><br>

                Let’s say the VPS is restricted to 10 users each with 20 GB of space but none are able to utilize that
                completely, then the host can allow their unused space to be utilized by other websites. So, rather than
                using storage on one server, cloud computing will store your data in 10 different servers. Therefore, if
                one network is busy, you can still operate using any of the 9 other networks. This feature of having
                different storage servers allows for a faster working of website, minimal downtime, and better control
                over your data.

            <h1>Static vs. Dynamic pages</h1>
            <p>
                Dynamic vs. Static Websites: What's the Difference?<br><br>

                There are essentially two types of websites: static and dynamic. However this can be confusing
                because<br>
                there can be static elements of a dynamic site, dynamic elements of a static site… as we continue into
                the age of Progressive Web Apps and website personalization, the lines become blurred between what’s
                static and dynamic.<br><br>

                What can be Static or Dynamic?<br>
                When discussing whether a site is static or dynamic, half of the battle is determining what aspect of
                the site you’re discussing. The code of the page, delivery of the page, and the client browser can all
                be considered either static or dynamic.<br><br>

                What’s a Dynamic Website?<br>
                Dynamic sites use server side languages to process requests at the time it’s made and generate a page
                and its contents in real-time. This means that dynamic websites interact with the user accessing the
                site and render content depending on the user’s actions or settings. One example of a dynamic website is
                web apps. Take Twitter as an example: when you log in, it displays content just for you.<br><br>

                While dynamic sites are extremely powerful they are also more complex. Along with this complexity are
                many advantages and disadvantages inherent to a dynamic site build.<br><br>

                Dynamic Site Advantages<br>
                Powered by Databases. By connecting a dynamic site to a database, you’re able to easily request
                information in an organized and structured way to create and display content depending on how the user
                wants to view it.<br>

                Connect to a CMS<br>
                This ability to connect to a database means that you can also connect to a CMS. Content stored in the
                CMS can be a variety of things, from the text to the images that are displayed, page layouts, site
                settings, and more. This allows for extreme flexibility when building sites, and also allows for
                multiple users to be able to manipulate content as needed.<br><br>

                Low Ongoing Maintenance Cost<br>
                Since you can connect a dynamic site to a CMS there are little or no ongoing costs unless there is a
                change in the basic design or an extra capability is added to the site.<br><br>

                Dynamic Site Disadvantages<br>
                Design Limitations<br>
                When generating content on a page from a database, you’re typically pulling in content and telling it to
                display a certain way, no matter what the content is. This can make design tricky, as you’ll likely opt
                for a one-size-fits-all approach. Depending on the CMS, it can be difficult to build multiple designs to
                display different types of content in different types of ways.<br><br>

                With dynamic sites, you are forced into using templates for your page, or you are committing to building
                custom templates for every page. This is easier in some CMSes such as Zesty.io but harder to do in
                others such as Wordpress or Drupal.<br><br>

                Can Incur Upfront Build Costs<br>
                When building a dynamic site, it can incur much more work upfront as you’re connecting the site to a
                database, building the foundation for the site to generate content, etc. Additional functionality may
                also cost more as you add features to your dynamic site throughout its life. While maintenance costs are
                low for a dynamic site, they can incur much higher initial build costs than a static site.<br><br>

                What’s a Static Website?<br>
                Static websites are pre-rendered, typically cached, and served by a CDN. The site is pre-generated by
                individual files that are delivered to all users in the same manner. There are advantages and
                disadvantages to choosing to build a static site.<br><br>

                Static Site Advantages<br>
                Flexibility<br>
                The main advantage of a static site is the flexibility it offers. Every page can be different; designs
                can change, layouts can differ, and the designer doesn’t have to make one design fit the mold for
                multiple types of content to display on a page.<br><br>

                Cost<br>
                Cost can be lower upfront to build a static site than to build a dynamic site. Since pages don’t have to
                be connected to a database to generate content and render the view, they can be less expensive than a
                dynamic site to build. However, hooking up a headless CMS to a static site generator and then a delivery
                network can make a static site expensive to build.<br><br>

                Load Times<br>
                Since static sites are pre-rendered, the load times are very fast. Without complex scripting, a
                database, parsing content through templating languages, etc. these sites typically load in a
                snap.<br><br>

                Static Site Disadvantages<br>
                More Difficult to Update<br>
                Static sites can be challenging to change once they’re built- even making small content tweaks can be
                challenging. Unless you are familiar with HTML, CSS, and the code of the site, you may have to ask your
                developer who originally built the site to make changes to the site for you.<br><br>

                More Difficult to Scale<br>
                Adding to a static site over time can also be more difficult than with a dynamic site. For instance,
                creating product pages means that you have to construct a new page every time you want to add a new
                product page, which can take time and incur ongoing maintenance costs.<br><br>
